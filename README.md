# Network Malware Detection

This repository contains the code, datasets, and saved models for a network malware detection system. The project aims to detect and prevent malware intrusions in network traffic using machine learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- **`network_intrussion_detection.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **`data/`**: Directory containing the CSV files used for training and testing the model.
  - `NSL_KDD_Train.csv`: The training dataset.
  - `processed_train_data.csv`: Preprocessed training data.
  - `processed_network_capture.csv`: Test dataset for network capture.
  - `updated_test_data.csv`: Updated test data after preprocessing.
  - `popupfile.csv`: Raw test data.
- **`saved_models/`**: Directory containing the saved machine learning models.
  - `my_test_model.h5`: The trained Keras model.
  - `final_model.keras`: The final RNN model saved after cross-validation.
